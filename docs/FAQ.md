## FAQ's Partially Borrowed Based on 100 Days of Code and Then Tweaked

**Q:** How do I get in touch with the people who are also doing this challenge?<br />
**A:** Search for #100DaysOfHealthing on Twitter. Also, I set up [@100DaysHealth](https://twitter.com/100DaysHealth) on Twitter; stay tuned!


**Q:**The public part of this troubles me. What should I do?<br />
**A:**Whatever works best for you. Really. I mean, I'd love to hear it if you are participating, and letting people in your life know you're doing this can be super powerful. A casual "how's the 100 days going?" is super motivating! But! Getting 3+ months of awesomeness privately is better than not doing it because of the public component.

**Q:** I’ve missed a day, does it mean I’ve failed the challenge?<br />
**A:** Absolutely not. Do your best to only miss one day every two weeks. Never miss two days in a row (so you can’t skip the 14th day of one week period and the 1st day of another). Alex mentions that he got this great piece of advice on habit formation from Leo Babauta at [zen habits][zenhab].

**Q:** I come home late, and by the time I am finished with my hour, it’s past midnight, does it count?<br />
**A:** Of course it counts! The rule of thumb is: have you taken care of your health or yourself for at least an hour before going to sleep that day? If yes, you are on track. I currently have a 250+ day meditation streak, but sometimes my meditation for the day is at 1:23am. It's ok.

**Q:**How should I track this?<br />
**A:**Listen, journaling itself could be the self-care you need, so I'm gonna propose you do that (and if you need a journal, let me know; I love my [Field Notes][fieldnotes] and would love to send you one!). Use the Github repo. Tweet about it.  Whatever is best for you!

**Q:** If everyone started on a certain day, should I join them on the day they are? For example, from Day 12?<br />
**A:** Go ahead and start on Day 1. Just mention the day you're on when you post about it!

**Q:** What's a Github?<br />
**A:** Don't learn Github just for this project unless you want to.

**Q:** Why "Healthing" and not "health?"<br />
**A:** Because internet.
