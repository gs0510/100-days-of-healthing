### Day 1: Jan 3, 2017

**What I did**
- Meditation using Headspace 10 min
- bath 45 min
- Doctor appointment / took care of prescription right away

**Thoughts**

I like the idea of an hour straight thru, but that didn't happen today. I also need to think of bedtime as self-care; stayed up way too late with that bath! üõÅ
