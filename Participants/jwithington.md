### Day 1: Jan 3, 2017

**What I did**

- Meditation using Headspace 10 min
- bath 45 min
- Doctor appointment / took care of prescription right away

**Thoughts**

I like the idea of an hour straight thru, but that didn't happen today. I also need to think of bedtime as self-care; stayed up way too late with that bath! 🛁

### Day 2: Jan 4, 2017

**What I did**

- Headspace commuting meditation 10 min.
- Attended a Zen Service (7-915pm)

**Thoughts**

Great to be back at a sangha.

### Day 3: Jan 5, 2017

**What I did**

- Read / listened to a lot of [Radical Acceptance](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC2NHG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) 📖
- Took a bath 🛁
- Meditated 🙏

**Thoughts**

Today was a challenge for my #100Days.  I still need to get better about going to bed on time -- I did last night, and so today had an amazing morning...and then tonight I stayed up too late. Gonna maybe start considering "bed by 11" as part of my "hour".
