### Day 1: Jan 3, 2017

**What I did**

- Meditation using Headspace 10 min
- bath 45 min
- Doctor appointment / took care of prescription right away

**Thoughts**

I like the idea of an hour straight thru, but that didn't happen today. I also need to think of bedtime as self-care; stayed up way too late with that bath! 🛁

### Day 2: Jan 4, 2017

**What I did**

- Headspace commuting meditation 10 min.
- Attended a Zen Service (7-915pm)

**Thoughts**

Great to be back at a sangha.

### Day 3: Jan 5, 2017

**What I did**

- Read / listened to a lot of [Radical Acceptance](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC2NHG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) 📖
- Took a bath 🛁
- Meditated 🙏

**Thoughts**

Today was a challenge for my #100Days.  I still need to get better about going to bed on time -- I did last night, and so today had an amazing morning...and then tonight I stayed up too late. Gonna maybe start considering "bed by 11" as part of my "hour".

### Day 4: Jan 6, 2017

**What I did**

- Acupuncture.  She worked on my back, because it needs it, and it was scary but I managed! And that's a big thing, too.
- Therapy.
- Watched half a movie with Erin
- Short meditation

**Thoughts**

This feels like cheating, though maybe it shouldn't? Part of why I began this projeect was that I have a ton of things going on with health and so 1 hour a day of Code was gonna be hard. I also sorta wanted to frame it in a bigger frame of "this really is a project!" Yet, "I went to my appointment and then I went to my other appointment" seems like a cop out.

Why?

That's a thing to reflect upon, I think.

### Day 5: 010717

**What I did**
- finished watching a movie with Erin 📽️
- meditation break with Erin 🙏
- walks with friends 🚶
- tea at heart (while working, but still)
- Listened to [On Being](http://www.onbeing.org/program/maria-popova-cartographer-of-meaning-in-a-digital-age/7580)

**Thoughts**

On "cheating":  I found a good bit of writing (below) that suggested that things like taking care of doctor/professonal care stuff is definitely self-care. As it said:

>It's important to recognise when you need to see a doctor, therapist or natural healer.

After reading it, I thought, "duh." But the reminder was good.

### Day 6:  010817

**What I did**
- nice bath 🛁
- watched my stories
- headspace meditation
- set up journal for the week

**Reflection**

All day I tried to just...color. At the coffee table. I kept resisting. It was interesting!  And I'm wondering why, of course.

### Day 7:  010917

**What I did**

- coloring/meditation break at work 🙏
- coffee reward for workin' hard ☕
- coloring at home with the dog 🐶
- meditation (i meditate every day so yeah) 🙏

**Reflection**

My work gives us 3 times a day when we can meditate, and I set an intention for the week to use one or more of them each day, even when I work from home. For day 7, I used the 12:45pm slot, which is meditation and/or coloring & drawing. It was nice!

I noticed I was pretty tense today, and its carrying into Tuesday. Gonna try and figure that out.
