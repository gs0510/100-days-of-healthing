### Day 1: Jan 3, 2017

**What I did**

-   Meditation using Headspace 10 min
-   bath 45 min
-   Doctor appointment / took care of prescription right away

**Thoughts**

I like the idea of an hour straight thru, but that didn't happen today. I also need to think of bedtime as self-care; stayed up way too late with that bath! üõÅ

### Day 2: Jan 4, 2017

**What I did**

-   Headspace commuting meditation 10 min.
-   Attended a Zen Service (7-915pm)

**Thoughts**

Great to be back at a sangha.

### Day 3: Jan 5, 2017

**What I did**

-   Read / listened to a lot of [Radical Acceptance](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FC2NHG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) üìñ
-   Took a bath üõÅ
-   Meditated üôè

**Thoughts**

Today was a challenge for my #100Days.  I still need to get better about going to bed on time -- I did last night, and so today had an amazing morning...and then tonight I stayed up too late. Gonna maybe start considering "bed by 11" as part of my "hour".

### Day 4: Jan 6, 2017

**What I did**

-   Acupuncture.  She worked on my back, because it needs it, and it was scary but I managed! And that's a big thing, too.
-   Therapy.
-   Watched half a movie with Erin
-   Short meditation

**Thoughts**

This feels like cheating, though maybe it shouldn't? Part of why I began this projeect was that I have a ton of things going on with health and so 1 hour a day of Code was gonna be hard. I also sorta wanted to frame it in a bigger frame of "this really is a project!" Yet, "I went to my appointment and then I went to my other appointment" seems like a cop out.

Why?

That's a thing to reflect upon, I think.

### Day 5: 010717

**What I did**

-   finished watching a movie with Erin üìΩÔ∏è
-   meditation break with Erin üôè
-   walks with friends üö∂
-   tea at heart (while working, but still)
-   Listened to [On Being](http://www.onbeing.org/program/maria-popova-cartographer-of-meaning-in-a-digital-age/7580)

**Thoughts**

On "cheating":  I found a good bit of writing (below) that suggested that things like taking care of doctor/professonal care stuff is definitely self-care. As it said:

>It's important to recognise when you need to see a doctor, therapist or natural healer.

After reading it, I thought, "duh." But the reminder was good.

### Day 6:  010817

**What I did**

-   nice bath üõÅ
-   watched my stories
-   headspace meditation
-   set up journal for the week

**Reflection**

All day I tried to just...color. At the coffee table. I kept resisting. It was interesting!  And I'm wondering why, of course.

***

### Day 7:  010917

**What I did**

-   coloring/meditation break at work üôè
-   coffee reward for workin' hard ‚òï
-   coloring at home with the dog üê∂
-   meditation (i meditate every day so yeah) üôè

**Reflection**

My work gives us 3 times a day when we can meditate, and I set an intention for the week to use one or more of them each day, even when I work from home. For day 7, I used the 12:45pm slot, which is meditation and/or coloring & drawing. It was nice!

I noticed I was pretty tense today, and its carrying into Tuesday. Gonna try and figure that out.

### Day 8: 1/10/17

**What I did**

-   daily meditation (Headspace this time üí™)
-   snow time with erin and tot
-   acupuncture

**Reflection**

Things are feeling more anxious these days, likely work-related. I gotta consider this more.

### Day 9: 1/11/17

**What I did**

-   meditate (always)
-   nice snow time and lunchy with erin

**Reflection**

Today almost feels like a day when, actually, I missed a day. Hard to explain why, but things didn't feel like "Taking care of myself" type things, today.

### Day 10: 1/12/17

**What I did**

-   went to bed very very early, stayed in bed almost 12 hours
-   went for a walk and got drinking chocolte cuz I was having a tough time
-   made an important phone call / reached out to friends re: tough time

**Reflection**

One of the good things about keeping this running tally is seeing a pattern of "oh hey, yeah, I've been having a hard time." Here's to improvements there.

### Day 11 1/13/17

**What I did**

-   watched a ton of Bob's Burgers with Erin
-   Headspace meditation

### Day 12: 1/14/17

**What I did**

-   some nice work time at VeloCult
-   watched a movie with Bean and Erin
-   finally showered üòÇ
-   short meditation (of course)

**Reflection**

Today was a mixed bag for self-care, but a really good one as far as conscious living. And in some ways I think that's even more what I'm hoping for. I helped Erin to the doctor, I watched a movie without looking at my phone every wo minutes, and I genuinely felt a bit hopeful about the weekend and the week. That's good stuff!
